      h2.heading Go Time saved Riskline $8,782/month with <span class='text-highlight'>fractional product design</span>

      p Finding great talent is difficult and time-consuming. Riskline made the smart decision to skip the headache and subscribe to Go Time’s design subscription. Don’t spend $151,980 a year—which is the median product designer salary. Of course after health insurance, benefits, and taxes, that designer can easily cost your business $201,373 a year. With Go Time’s design subscription, you get a dedicated, onshore designer at a fraction of the cost. Plus, the flexible subscription can be paused or cancelled anytime. The last thing you want in these turbulent times is to worry about is another round of layoffs.

      p Over the course of 4 months, Go Time helped Riskline accomplish a lot of goals: web app redesign, email designs, prototypes for high stakes demos, microsites, lead generator, new web app design, embeddable widget design, another lead generator, landing page design, another prototype, an interactive map tool, and one-pagers.
