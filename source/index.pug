        h3.title Our iterative process moves with you
        p Forget the old way of working with agencies where they create a rigid scope that is set for months. Many times these massive design projects flop. It’s too big. It’s too off-target. 
        p The speed at which we work removes all the risk of massive projects. Sometimes we’re off, and it’s ony 2-4 more days before you see another pass. When priorities change—we’re here for you. When an important pitch comes up—we’re here for you.
